This is done to ensure that the other wolves can identify them. The council is typically held once a month during the full moon, and after this inspection, the cubs are free to run where they please.

He emphasizes that while Shere Khan cannot kill Mowgli in the jungle, the situation is precarious since Akela, the Pack leader, is old and will eventually be unable to hunt. Bagheera warns Mowgli that many young wolves, influenced by Shere Khan, think a man-cub has no place with them. Bagheera tells Mowgli, \"the young wolves believe, as Shere Khan has taught them, that a man-cub has no place with the Pack.\" This indicates that Mowgli's identity as a human might put him at risk among the wolves.",

He adds that their hatred stems from the fact that Mowgli is a man and has helped the wolves by \"pulling out thorns from their feet,\" yet they still see him as an outsider.",

      "generated_response": "When the Monkey People, or the Bandar-log, found Mowgli, they initially offered him their company and a sense of importance by telling him how great, wise, strong, and wonderful they were. They expressed their desire to have him as a listener who could carry their words back to the Jungle-People, boasting about their own abilities and superiority. However, they did not provide him with food or any practical assistance, which left Mowgli feeling sore, angry, and hungry. He later requested food, but the monkeys went off to gather nuts and wild pawpaws, only to fall into fighting and fail to bring back what he needed. Thus, Mowgli's experience with the Bandar-log was more about their self-promotion than any tangible offer of help.",
